# Regex Data Extraction - Formative Assignment

This project demonstrates regular expression (regex) skills using Python.  
It extracts structured data from a large text block — useful for form validations, APIs, and data cleaning.

## 👨‍💻 Implemented Patterns

I implemented regex to extract the following data types:

- ✅ URLs
- ✅ Phone Numbers (multiple formats)
- ✅ Credit Card Numbers (with hyphens or spaces)
- ✅ Time (12-hour and 24-hour format)
- ✅ Currency Amounts (including commas and decimals)

## 📂 How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then:

```bash
python main.py
